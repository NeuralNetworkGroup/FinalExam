Wine Quality Data Set â€“ Red Wine

Dataset Description:
The red wine datasets are related to red variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. Due to privacy
and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g.
there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).
These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not
balanced (e.g. there are much more normal wines than excellent or poor ones). Outlier detection
algorithms could be used to detect the few excellent or poor wines. Also, we are not sure if all input
variables are relevant. So it could be interesting to test feature selection methods.
